# IRSAutoRefresh
Making refreshing your SIAK NG IRS page a one-clicker ;)

## How to use
Prerequisite: make sure you have either Mozilla Firefox (I highly recommend this), Google Chrome, or Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) installed

1) Run the program.

2) Input your SIAK NG username and password. Select the browser of your choice. Optional: Input refresh starting time. Format: hh:mm. Example: 09:00

3) Click "Run". A browser will automatically open. Don't interfere. Let the program run.

4) When you get a "Your IRS can now be filled" message.. well.. go fill it.

5) You're welcome!
